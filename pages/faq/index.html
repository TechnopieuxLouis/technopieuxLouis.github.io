                <summary role="button" class="outline">2. What is a helical pile?</summary>
                <p>The Techno Metal Post is a metal pile used as a foundation and works like a screw. It consists of a tube, a helical shaft at the bottom, and a plate at the top. The helix serves two purposes: it allows the pile to be screwed into the ground and provides load-bearing support. A helical pile is a steel foundation installed into the ground by screwing it in using specialised equipment. The top plate, which comes in several standard sizes, is precisely positioned at the required height and supports the load-bearing parts of the structure. The Techno Metal Post is available in various tube sizes and helix diameters.</p>

            <details name="faq">
                <summary role="button" class="outline">3. How much do helical piles cost? Are piles cheaper than concrete?</summary>
                <p>The cost of a pile will depend upon the type of project it will be used for. It will also depend upon the depth at which it will be set to provide a strong foundation. It is also cheaper than traditional concrete foundations when taking into account the time required for and costs of excavation, spoil removal and concrete curing time.<br>
                    Contact us and we will be delighted to look at your project and provide a budget estimate.</p>

                <summary role="button" class="outline">4. Do I need a soil survey?</summary>
                <p>The need for a soil survey will depend upon the planning authority in your area. Some smaller residential project may not need a soil survey. Techno Metal Post doesn’t provide soil survey, but can perform a probe test to assess the ground conditions and determine the necessary depth to reach proper bearing capacity.</p>

            <details name="faq">
                <summary role="button" class="outline">5. Why use a helical pile foundation instead of concrete?</summary>
                <p>Using helical piles will save you time and money, since they don’t require any excavation, concrete curing time or post installation adjustments. Techno Metal Posts are ready-to-build foundations. They also ensure your project’s stability will prevent additional costs resulting from possible soil movement.</p>

                <summary role="button" class="outline">6. Can I install Techno Metal Posts myself?</summary>
                <p>Our helical piles can only be installed by our certified installers, using our specially designed machines.</p>
            </details>

            <details name="faq">
                <summary role="button" class="outline">7. How long does it take to install?</summary>
                <p>Techno Metal post installation is unbelievably quick and accurate. We have delivered foundations for 250 sqm double-storey house in a few days. Installation time depends on the project type. It mainly varies based on the number of piles, soil conditions, and the site access situation.</p>

            <details name="faq">
                <summary role="button" class="outline">8. Is it possible to install helical piles in rocky soil conditions?</summary>
                <p>Our installation equipment can screw piles through soil containing small to moderate sized rocks. Our machines generate the appropriate torque for the pile to move these rocks. In the case of shallow bedrock or larger rocks, a specialized anchoring system can be used.</p>

            <details name="faq">
                <summary role="button" class="outline">9. What is the minimum access width you need for the installation equipment?</summary>
                <p>Our smallest machine, the R2D, can easily manoeuvre through a standard door frame (29 inches / 75 cm).</p>
            </details>

            <details name="faq">
                <summary role="button" class="outline">10. Do you have any certifications?</summary>
                <p>Yes. Our products meet current international standards and hold BBA, CE, ISO 9001, and UKCA certifications. This ensures safety, quality, and regulatory compliance for our clients. Our technology is approved by most mortgage providers.</p>

            <details name="faq">
                <summary role="button" class="outline">11. What is the maximum load that a pile can support?</summary>
                <p>Our helical piles can support up to 15 tonnes per pile, hence providing an adequate foundation for all residential projects.</p>
